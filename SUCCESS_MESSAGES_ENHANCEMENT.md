### **1. BASCA Registration:**
```
✅ Success! Your registration has been submitted.

   account is approved.

### **3. Senior Registration:**
```
✅ Success! Your registration has been submitted.

✅ A confirmation email has been sent to senior@example.com

// On successful registration
if (result.success) {
  setSuccess(true);  // Show success message
  setError(null);    // Clear any errors
}
```

### **Success Alert Component:**
```tsx
{success && (
  <Alert className="border-green-500 bg-green-50">
    <CheckCircle2 className="h-4 w-4 text-green-600" />
    <AlertDescription className="ml-2 text-green-800">
      <strong>Success!</strong> Your registration has been submitted.
      
      <div className="mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm">
        {/* Email confirmation */}
        <p>✅ A confirmation email has been sent to <strong>{email}</strong></p>
        
        {/* Role-specific message */}
        {selectedRole === 'basca' && (
          <p>⏳ Your account is pending approval from the OSCA administrator...</p>
        )}
        {selectedRole === 'osca' && (
          <p>✅ You can now login with your credentials.</p>
        )}

        Go to Login Page
      </Button>
    </AlertDescription>
  </Alert>
)}
```

### **Form Disabled After Success:**
```tsx
<Button
  type="submit"
  disabled={isLoading || success}  // Disabled when successful
  className={isLoading || success ? 'bg-gray-600 cursor-not-allowed' : '...'}
>
  {isLoading ? 'Creating Account...' : 
   success ? 'Registration Complete' :    // New text when successful
